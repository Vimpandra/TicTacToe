# TicTacToe
My TicTacToe project for The Odin Project's fullstack javascript developer course.

To Do:
    
- Add option to input player name
- find a way to save which player made the winning move
- make the function that builds the end screen's messages
- keep score between games
- add the PvP mode
- let player choose symbol: 'X' goes first / 'O' goes last
